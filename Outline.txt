The way the text is positioned and revealed should be determined by the scene.


some functions
	load a new scene
		-> an SO with 
			a prefab scene instance 
				maybe the instance has a bunch of nodes for text, etc, if we're moving the camera a lot in / out 
			text styling
			movement type
			
			etc
	transition type
	get player input from some object
	change a variable (probably don't need it, we can save in the ink json)
	clear all the text and start the scene over 
	
	
	


Tags seem like they'll come in a couple styles
	before we show the text 
	after we show text 
	requires new scene load
